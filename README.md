## Refactoring a website for SEO, aka. putting the "SEO" in Horiseon.

The purpose of this repo was to take existing code and refactor it to meet a certain set of standards of web accessibility. This is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.

My task was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. I needed to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than I found it. 

To impress the "client" for this Challenge, I improved their codebase for long-term sustainability. I have ensured that all links are functioning correctly and I have cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.



## User Story

```

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
